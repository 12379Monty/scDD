You can also preview the\ntext and code in the vignette (without the results it produces) in the raw\n.Rnw file without first installing scDD by clicking [here](https://github.com/kdkorthauer/scDD/blob/master/vignettes/scDD.Rnw).\n\nPlease send bug reports and feature requests by opening a new issue on \n[this page](https://github.com/kdkorthauer/scDD/issues). \n\nPlease cite the following publication if you use scDD in your work:\n> Korthauer KD, Chu LF, Newton MA, Li Y, Thomson J, Stewart R, \nKendziorski C.
